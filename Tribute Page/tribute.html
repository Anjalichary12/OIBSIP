Ratan Tata is a former Indian businessman and industrialist.
 He was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, on December 28, 1937.
He is the son of Naval Tata and Sooni Tata, the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata.

Tata was the chairman of the Tata Group until December 2012.

 He briefly returned as interim chairman in 2016 after his successor, Cyrus Mistry, was ousted. He retired again in January 2017. 
 Tata is currently the Chairman Emeritus of the Tata Group.
Tata is known for his leadership and philanthropic activities.
 He is involved in many activities that provide education and quality life in rural India.
A big challenge Ratan Tata faced was when he met the Ford leadership to sell the Tata Group’s car business. The deal didn’t come through but Tata worked towards boosting the auto business. In 2008, nine years later, when Ford was on the brink of bankruptcy, it was Tata who managed to seal the company’s Jaguar Land Rover acquisition for over $2 billion. Further testimony to his power to overcome challenges came during the 26/11 terror attacks when he led the efforts to help victims outside the Taj hotel. To quote his own words, “If you want to walk fast, walk alone. If you want to walk far, walk together.” </p>
